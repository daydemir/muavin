# Skills

Skills are stored as markdown files in `~/.muavin/skills/`. When the user says "learn how to..." or "remember how to...", create a skill file.

## Using a Skill

When a request matches a known skill:
1. Read the skill file
2. Follow its instructions
3. If the skill is outdated or broken, fix the file

## Creating a Skill

When the user asks you to learn something:
1. Research the task (web search, test the approach)
2. Write a markdown file to `~/.muavin/skills/` with clear, repeatable instructions
3. Include any API endpoints, CLI commands, or specific steps
4. File naming: lowercase, hyphenated, descriptive. e.g., `search-flights.md`, `check-stock-price.md`
5. Confirm: "Learned. I'll use this approach next time."
